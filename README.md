## Environment & Configuration

- Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug’s `generate_password_hash` and `check_password_hash`
- User authentication is managed through server-side sessions
- A `venv/` virtual environment is used for dependency isolation (not included in the repo)
- Application configuration and the SQLite database are stored in the `instance/` directory, which is excluded from version control for security
- All unnecessary or sensitive files and folders are ignored via `.gitignore`

## Future Features

- Player registration system
- User authentication is managed through server-side sessions
- Match history filters (by date, opponent, etc.)
- Leaderboard and win percentages
- Graphs/charts for performance over time
